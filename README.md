# TEI schema for bibliographic references

This repository contains a TEI schema, maintained in the ODD format, from which an XSD 
schema is generated via the https://roma.tei-c.org/ tool. 

We also provide examples which are validated by the schema.

This is a work-in-progress meant to be discussed. The schema might change any time.
