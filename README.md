# TEI schema for bibliographic references

This repository contains a [TEI schema](./schema/tei-bib.odd), maintained in the 
[ODD format](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/customization/getting-started-with-p5-odds/), 
from which an [XSD schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/) is generated via the 
https://roma.tei-c.org/ tool. 

We also provide [examples](./examples/) which are validated by the schema.

This is a work-in-progress meant to be discussed. The schema might change any time.
